This project parses results published by BEC (Biroul Electoral Central) and provides real time partial results for elections in Romania.

[See the project live](insert_link_here)

The partial results published by BEC (Biroul Electoral Central) are often raw results that are not easily interpreted and give no meaningful information to regular users. The aim of the project is to aggregate the raw data and provide timely updates on the progression of voting results in Romanian elections.
